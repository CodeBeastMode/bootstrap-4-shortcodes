# ** WORK IN PROGRESS**
This plugin is *not ready for use in production*. Not all Bootstrap 4 shortcodes are supported yet, and depending on development some featuers may break periodically. We will update this note when we're ready to release a production-ready version of this tool.

*Thank you!*

Bootstrap 4 Shortcodes for WordPress
===

![WordPress Rating](https://img.shields.io/wordpress/plugin/r/bootstrap-4-shortcodes.svg) ![WordPress Downloads](https://img.shields.io/wordpress/plugin/dt/bootstrap-4-shortcodes.svg)

WordPress plugin that provides shortcodes for easier use of the Bootstrap 4 styles and components in your content.

**Bootstrap 4 Shortcodes for WordPress** creates a simple, out of the way button just above the WordPress TinyMCE editor (next to the "Add Media" button) which pops up the plugin's documentation and shortcode examples for reference and handy "Insert Example" links to send the example shortcodes straight to the editor. There are no additional TinyMCE buttons to clutter up your screen, just great, easy to use shortcodes!

# Requirements
![Tested in WordPress](https://img.shields.io/wordpress/v/bootstrap-4-shortcodes.svg) ![PHP 5.3+](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-5.3%2B-blue.svg) ![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bootstrap-4-6f5499.svg)

This plugin won't do anything if you don't have WordPress theme built with the [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework. **This plugin does not include the Bootstrap framework**.

The plugin is tested to work with ```Bootstrap 4``` and ```WordPress 4.6``` and **requires PHP 5.3 or later**.
